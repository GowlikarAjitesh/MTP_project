# BEST - Benchmarking and Evaluation for Segmentation and Tracking for Autonomous Vehicles in Adverse Conditions

### Initial Work
 - My initial work was to benchmark and evaluate the foundational model called SAM2 (Segment Anything Model) and YOLOv8.
 - Metrics: IoU, mIoU
 - Dataset: ACDC dataset

### Current Work
  - Now my work includes benchmarking and evaluating various models in the domain of object tracking, like
    1. DeepSort
    2. Bot-SORT
    3. ByteTrack
    
  - **Metrics**: HOTA, IDF1, MOTA, MOTP
  
  - **Dataset**: SAV dataset
